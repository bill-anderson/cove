Introduction
============

CoVE is an web application to Convert, Validate and Explore data following certain open data standards - currently 360Giving and the Open Contracting Data standard. http://cove.opendataservices.coop

CoVE is current in an alpha/beta state.

Why convert data?
+++++++++++++++++

The W3C `Data on the Web Best Practices <http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/>`_ recommend making open data available in a range of formats to meet the needs of different users. Developers may want JSON, researchers might prefer a spreadsheet format.

CoVE manages the process of converting between JSON, Excel and CSV formats for structured data. 

Validate and Explore
++++++++++++++++++++

CoVE presents key validation information during the process, and can be configured to display information about the contents of a data file, so that it can be easily inspected.

Supported formats
+++++++++++++++++

CoVE currently supports conversion from: 

* JSON to multi-tabbed Excel files 
* Excel to JSON (it uses the `flatten-tool <(https://github.com/OpenDataServices/flatten-tool>`_ for conversion) 
 
If a JSON schema is supplied, CoVE can use either field names, or user-friendly column titles. 

Release Cycle
=============

CoVE is in constant development.
There are public instances in use at:
http://cove.opendataservices.coop/
http://standard.open-contracting.org/validator/

We deploy the latest version of CoVE at the end of each calendar month (usually the last Thursday of the Month).
We make development version ready for user testing (mainly internally) two weeks before deployment. Our cut off date for new features to be considered in that cycle is the week before that.

Feature requests, bugs, questions and answers etc are all handled via GitHub.
We use release cycle milestones to organise those issues.
We also use Huboard as a way to prioritise issues and indicate what is being worked on.
 
Serious Bug fixes and 'priority' features, that need to make it into a release at short notice can be included by negotiation.

Requirements
============
This application is built using Django and Python 3

Installation
============
Steps to installation:

* Clone the repository
* Change into the cloned repository
* Create a virtual environment (note this application uses python3)
* Activate the virtual environment
* Install dependencies
* Set up the database (sqlite3)
* Compile the translations
* Run the development server

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/OpenDataServices/cove.git
    cd cove
    virtualenv .ve --python=/usr/bin/python3
    source .ve/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py compilemessages
    python manage.py runserver

Follow the instructions in your terminal to open the aplication in your browser.

Deployment
==========

See https://github.com/OpenDataServices/cove/blob/master/DEPLOYMENT.md

Run tests
=========

.. code:: bash

    py.test

To generate a coverage report (in the htmlcov directory):

.. code:: bash

    py.test --cov cove --cov-report html

The tests include functional tests (actually interacting with the website in selenium). These can also be run against a deployed copy of the website:

.. code:: bash

    CUSTOM_SERVER_URL=http://dev.cove.opendataservices.coop py.test fts 

We also use flake8 to test code quality, see https://github.com/OpenDataServices/developer-docs/blob/master/tests.md#flake8 

Translations
============

| We use Django's transaltion framework to provide this application in different languages.
| We have used Google Translate to perform initial translations from English, but expect those translations to be worked on by humans over time.

Translations for Translators
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Translators can provide translations for this application by becomming a collaborator on Transifex https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/cove

Translations for Developers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
For more information about Django's translation framework, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/i18n/translation/

If you add new text to the interface, ensure to wrap it in the relevant gettext blocks/functions.

In order to generate messages and post them on transifex:

.. code:: bash

    python manage.py makemessages -l en
    tx push -s

In order to fetch messages from transifex:

.. code:: bash

    tx pull -a

In order to compile them:

.. code:: bash

    python manage.py compilemessages

Do not do not this process on every text change so as not to pollute the commit diffs.  
Keep the makemessages and pull messages steps in thier own commits seperate from the text changes.

The aim is to run this process each month, but it can be done more regulularly if needed.

To check that all new text is written so that it is able to be translated you could install and run `django-template-i18n-lint`

.. code:: bash

    pip install django-template-i18n-lint
    django-template-i18n-lint cove

Adding and updating requirements
================================

Add a new requirements to ``requirements.in`` or ``requirements_dev.in`` depending on whether it is just a development requirement or not.

Then, run ``./update_requirements --new-only`` this will populate ``requirements.txt`` and/or ``requirements_dev.txt`` with pinned versions of the new requirement and it's dependencies. WARNING: This will delete and recreate your current ``.ve`` directory.

``./update_requirements`` without any flags will update all pinned requirements to the latest version. Generally we don't want to do this at the same time as adding a new dependency, to make testing any problems easier.
